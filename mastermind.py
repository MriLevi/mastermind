### I've had to adjust quite a few modules and functions, but a good amount of them have been left as is
### I will annotate which ones have been written by me or extensively rewritten by me.
### Most of the class based structure was already in place.
### Theres a few parser flags that I have not programmed in
### These are all not used: no duplicates, the amount of colors, and the amount of positions
### I could program them in but they were not needed for the assignment, so I left them as is
